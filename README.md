# AlgoVisuals (v.1.1)
> An all-inclusive algorithm visualizer with common sorting and pathfinding algorithms.

To use, first run the code and select the algorithm you would like from the dropdown menu, then press randomize once. The canvas will generate either a grid or a bunch of unsorted bars depending on the type of algorithm.

Happy viewing!
